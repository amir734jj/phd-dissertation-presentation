\section{Conclusion}

\begin{frame}{What has been done so far?}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Defined circular remote attribute grammar
    \item Defined what makes a schedule valid for CRAG
    \item Defined visit sequence for CRAG
    \item \alert{Proposed} an algorithm to statically evaluate CRAG
    \item \alert{Identified} the modifications needed for APS to support CRAG
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\note[itemize]{
\item We have made a lot of progress done so far up to this point including ...
}

\begin{frame}{Next Steps}{Coding + Testing + Benchmarking}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \alert{Implementation} of visit sequence evaluation for CRAG in APS
    \item Statically scheduling First and Follow to validate our work
    \item Statically scheduling \emph{Cool} compiler semantic analyzer
    \item Benchmarking APS implementation against JastAdd
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\note[itemize]{
\item The final question is what is remaining to be done?
