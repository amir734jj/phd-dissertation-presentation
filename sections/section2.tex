\begin{frame}{JastAdd}{Closely related attribute grammar system}
Introduced by Hedin in \cite{DBLP:journals/entcs/HedinM01}
		
\begin{itemize}
    \item \alert{Imperative}
    \item \alert{Demand Evaluation only}
    \item Supports collections
    \item Supports Remote Attribute Grammars
    \item \alert{Supports Circular Remote Attribute Grammar}
    \item Syntactically close to Java
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\note[itemize]{
\item JastAdd is an example of an attribute grammar system that supports circular remote attribute grammar
\item It was created by Hedin
\item But it is an imperative attribute grammar system and only supports demand evaluation
}

\begin{frame}{APS}{Main focus of this thesis}
Introduced by Dr. Boyland in \cite{10.5555/924544}
		
\begin{itemize}
    \item \alert{Declarative}
    \item \alert{Static Evaluation}
    \item Demand Evaluation
    \item Supports collections
    \item Supports Remote Attribute Grammars
    \item Target code generation originally in Lisp, and then later on to C++ and Scala
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\note[itemize]{
\item APS is an attribute grammar system created by Dr. Boyland
\item It's declarative and supports static and demand evaluation
