\begin{frame}{JastAdd}{Closely related attribute grammar system}
Introduced by Hedin in \cite{DBLP:journals/entcs/HedinM01}
		
\begin{itemize}
    \item \alert{Imperative}
    \item Demand Evaluation
    \item Supports collections
    \item Supports Remote Attribute Grammars
    \item \alert{Supports Circular Remote Attribute Grammar} via an artifact
    \item Syntactically close to Java
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\note[itemize]{
\item JastAdd is an example of attribute grammar system that support circular remote attribute grammars
\item It was created by Hedin
\item But its an imperative attribute grammar system and only supports dynamic evaluation
}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \alert{Declarative}
    \item \alert{Static Evaluation}
    \item Demand Evaluation
    \item Supports collections
    \item Supports Remote Attribute Grammars
    \item Target code generation originally in Lisp, and then later on to C++ and Scala
\end{itemize}

\note[itemize]{
\item APS is an attribute grammar system created by Dr. Boyland
\item Its imperative and supports static and dynamic evaluation
